What is REST API
Rest = Representational state transfer 

REST stands for “Representational State Transfer” and is the set of rules that developers follow when creating an API. REST is read using JSON as we covered previously. 

Api   =  Application Programming interface

API stands for Application Programming Interface. APIs are used for one program to communicate with another. The advantage of API is that you don't need to know how it works inside the API I'm using. Just know how to send a request to API and what kind of response will come.
